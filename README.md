MCMC for Uncertainty Quantification

Code for solving inverse problem with additive noise using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In the code, a 1D function is used as the unknown for a Y=AX+E forward model.
The code approximates X using MCMC (Metropolis Hastings) with the Weighted (VBJS) ell_1 prior
